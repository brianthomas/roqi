in order to extract data for the project, you need to run following:

1. Mathews script to get the data from registries
2. run extract_subject_metadata.pl on selected metadata to extract basic, raw
   metadata. For example:

   > perl extract_subject_metadata.pl data-march-2009/cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/*.xml > cds_roqi_raw5.owl

3. Extract the resource metadata into xml form using extract_resources_from_onto.pl, for
   example:

   > perl extract_resources_from_onto.pl cds_roqi_raw5.owl > cds_resources.xml 

4. Create the ontology for the tool to use using trim_resource_metadata_in_onto.pl,
   for example:

   > perl trim_resource_metadata_in_onto.pl cds_roqi_raw5.owl > tmp.owl 

5. Fix inheritance of subjects in the extracted ontology. Fix_subject_inheritance.pl
   will do some minimal ordering under Subject and top classes (you may want to use
   ontology editor like protege to further order the hierarchy after running the script).
   
   > perl fix_subject_inheritance.pl tmp.owl > roqi.owl
   
6. Copy over roqi.owl into src/main/resources

7. Use the ResourceLoaderApp , with the --initdb option, to create and load the 
   resource metadata in extracted resource file (cds_resources.xml in the example above).
